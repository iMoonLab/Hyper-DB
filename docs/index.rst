========================
Hypergraph-DB Overview
========================

Hypergraph-DB is a lightweight, flexible, and Python-based database designed to model and manage **hypergraphs**â€”a generalized graph structure where edges (hyperedges) can connect any number of vertices. This makes Hypergraph-DB an ideal solution for representing complex relationships between entities in various domains, such as knowledge graphs, social networks, and scientific data modeling.

Hypergraph-DB provides a high-level abstraction for working with vertices and hyperedges, making it easy to add, update, query, and manage hypergraph data. With built-in support for persistence, caching, and efficient operations, Hypergraph-DB simplifies the management of hypergraph data structures.
